          <h1>Build Technology for the Public Good</h1>
          <p>We're an in-house team of engineers, designers, and product managers who build systems that improve the public good. We proactively identify areas where technology can help, test our prototypes with actual users, and bring our best ones to launch.
            We use and release open source software, keep a flat hierarchy, and bypass bureaucracy to focus on delivery.</p>

          <h3>Solve real problems</h3>
          <p>Work on meaningful projects from transport to healthcare. Improve access to education and justice. Donâ€™t waste your skills building another shopping cart. Have a real impact on people's lives.</p>

          <h3>Build for the user</h3>
          <p>Design and build products based on what real people actually need. No corporate agendas and no buzzword campaigns. We don't serve our bosses, our agency, or even our ministers. We are public servants, we serve the public.</p>

          <h3>Push for change</h3>
          <p>Actively prototype and evangelize ideas to make real things happen. Don't wait for opportunities to come, identify and pursue them. Work around or cut through bureaucracy. It's our job to challenge the status quo and make things better.</p>

          <h2>How we work</h2>

          <h3>Direct Ownership</h3>
          <p>See a problem? Prototype and propose a solution. Talk to users. Test and iterate. Figure out the right thing to do and do that. Your job is to solve problems not follow instructions.</p>

          <h3>Support &amp; Development</h3>
          <p>Share your knowledge and learn from each other at our regular learning lunches. Brainstorm and build together during hackathons. Allocate time to learn new skills. Each new project needs a new approach, and the better we understand each other
            the more effective we are.</p>

          <h3>Flexible Work Arrangements</h3>
          <p>Work from home if you need to. Set your own schedule. As long as you can work with your team and get stuff done. No staying late just to look busy. No fussing about sick days. We believe in hiring good people and treating them like adults.</p>
