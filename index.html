          <h1>Build Technology for the Public Good</h1>
          <p>We're an in-house team of engineers, designers, and product managers who build systems that improve the public good. We proactively identify areas where technology can help, test our prototypes with actual users, and bring our best ones to launch. We use and release open source software, keep a flat hierarchy, and bypass bureaucracy to focus on delivery.</p>
